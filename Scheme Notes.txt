If I am correct, car will return the first item in the list.  cdr will return a list excluding the first element.

I'm confused on the other variations of these, more specifically things like cadar, caddr, cddr, etc.

Say I have this as a random example:

define X '(a b (c d e))

(car X)
(cdr X)
(cadr X)
(cadar X)
(car X) would produce a, (cdr X) would produce (b (c d e)), cadr would produce b. But I don't know how to infer any other variation of car/cdr like cadar.

You can infer the meaning of these functions by parsing their name:

between the first letter ('c') and the last ('r'), a 'a' means "the car of" and a 'd' means "the cdr of".

So:

cadr is "the car of the cdr",
cddr is the cdr of the cdr,
cadar is the "car of the cdr of the car" (thus the parameter has to be a list of list),
etc.
